## About me
Yes, I worked in cancer research for 7 years, mostly because I didn’t know what else to do with a biology degree that wasn’t med school or grad school.

I eventually figured out that what really motivates me is empowering people with information. A [random side project](/projects/wssr/) led me to UX, I [cobbled together a design education](/writing/changing-careers/) for myself, then I happened to land in government. 

My dogged urge to get empowering information to people has gotten me on projects involving affordable housing, permitting, and COVID.

## About this site
The 2024 version of my website is not meant for recruiters or hiring managers. I have nothing to prove to anybody. I have already achieved everything I have ever wanted in my career, and I can’t wait to see what naturally develops next.

(Also, I am fairly certain that nobody who ended up hiring me has ever looked at my website, hah.)

**This website is primarily for people who are new to either design or civic tech**, wondering what working in government is *actually* like. Or wondering what it took for me to get here. That’s why I’ve kept my [student and pro-bono projects online](/projects/), the way I originally wrote them back around 2014.

So if that describes you, welcome! I hope what I’ve written is helpful. I’d love to meet you and give you words of encouragement. Feel free to book a mentoring call with me [on ADPList](https://adplist.org/mentors/anita-cheng) or [message me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anitaycheng).

The (admitedly old but still amazingly fitting) photo of me was taken by the irrepressible **[Jing Marshall](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jingmarshall/)**.

This site uses **IBM Plex Sans** for headings, because [just look at this *beautiful* differentiation](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Sans?preview.text=I%20l%201%20i&preview.text_type=custom). Body copy is **[Lora](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lora)**. Animated icons are from **[Unicorn Icons](https://unicornicons.com/)**.
