date: '2012-03'
work_description: A CD anthology encompassing 20 years of Tori Amos's career, focusing on her interest in feminine archetypes. This project was eventually found by Tori memorabilia collectors on Facebook. I sold the box to one of them, and it's been making the rounds in that group ever since!

## Introduction
Having once been a teenaged female, Tori Amos was a very influential part of my developing years. Among her numerous album compilations throughout her 20-year career, I was surprised that there was nothing to commemorate her fascination with various feminine archetypes in numerous myths and religions.

For this project I aimed to design a collector’s edition CD anthology targeted at the Tori fans who would follow her on tours, having listened to her music since their formative years. This would be special and personal, just for them.

## What I did

### Content strategy
The most maligned feminine concept that frankly needed some empowering is the myth of Pandora’s box.

In my historical research, I found that Pandora was originally associated with the earth (and presumably non-godly things) which turned off the poet who wrote how she screws over mankind. I sought to shift the common perception of Pandora and give some integrity back to her story.

### Visual design
Within this new version of Pandora’s box would be hope instead of despair, in the “winged” (i.e., vellum-covered) form of Tori’s music. Throughout the designs, I reflected on the idea of earthly cycles and its power, driven by the imagery of Tori in concert as well as the music itself.

## Make one yourself!
Due to the unexpected popularity of the one-off set in Tori memorabilia groups on Facebook, I put the designs on Dropbox. If you are crafty, [you could make it yourself!](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/4qfa5m350ss6asd/AAB4H_raOgQ1Wm4tXKl_hKSXa?dl=0) (It even includes detailed instructions, of course.)
