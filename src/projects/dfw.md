## Introduction

Although David Foster Wallace is most renowned for his modernist fiction, the essays he wrote for magazines throughout his career are intensely personal, accessible, and his optimism for humanity is evident throughout.

I designed a book set to contain the essay collections published during his lifetime, as well as the only commencement speech he gave. The set was targeted at readers from 20-50, who were already fans of the author.

## Content strategy

After reading a number of the essays he wrote, I noted four themes running through them that could be visualized:

1. Clarity in a world of noise
2. Focusing in on a tiny detail in an otherwise mundane existence
3. Floating helplessly while the world churns around you
4. The individual making a decision to fight against the default of a group

	{% galleryImage "src/images/DFWcloseup.jpg", "Closeup concept, with a closeup image of window washing suds on a window" %}
	{% galleryImage "src/images/DFWfloating.jpg", "Floating concept, with a photograph of a man's legs dangling out of a floating tube in a pool." %}
	{% galleryImage "src/images/DFWindividualgroup.jpg", "Individual vs group concept, with a image of a line of people with one person at the end looking the other direction." %}
{% endgallery %}
	
In the end, I combined the first and second themes, determining that Wallaceâ€™s writing style is most characterized by his ability to amusingly make light of very small details that others would surely overlook.

I designed around a theme of magnification for the packaging and layouts, as well as utilizing handwritten typefaces to communicate his personability.

## Visual design

I tested out many handwritten typefaces, aiming to find one that had the right balance of whimsy and introspection.

I also brought the magnification theme into the inside of the books themselves, always reminding the reader. No detail was too small to focus on, pun completely intended!

## Final design

{% image "src/images/DFWbookcovers.jpg", "All three DFW book covers, with a magnifying glass zoomed in on a cruise towel animal, lobster, and a goldfish respectively.", "All these animals on the book covers look bemused being under a microscope." %}

{% image "src/images/DFWwater.jpg", "This is Water book cover, with a goldfish being magnified, and text surrounded by brackets.", "This goldfish looks particularly confused, even on a minimalist book cover." %}

{% image "src/images/DFWopenbook.jpg", "A Supposedly Fun Thing book text, with the first few letters of the essay title magnified.", "I truly appreciate the whimsical details of the essay titles when they're magnified." %}

{% image "src/images/DFWbox.jpg", "Life According to DFW packaging, with two areas of magnification over the photograph of a carnival.", "It all seems to come together in a carnival!" %}
