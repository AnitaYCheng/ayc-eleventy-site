## My role

I was contracted by Deep 6 Analytics to streamline the flow through their complex, specialized big data analytics platform, which had been built by the engineers as a placeholder. I redesigned the UI for their dashboard and analytics tool.

## Challenges

Being new to big data, I had to get up to speed with specialized terminology and how the platform worked in only a few days. I also helped prototype front-end code for the developers, familiarizing myself with the template they were using.

The platform would have to be robust to cater to experienced data scientists experimenting with large data sets, yet flexible and understandable enough for information to be shared among scientists handling various types of data.

## What I did

### Sketches

{% image "src/images/D6Asketches.jpg", "Rough sketch wireframes of workflows", "I experimented with several layouts, to maximize efficiency throughout the pages." %}

### Photoshop mockups

 {% image "src/images/D6ADashboard.jpg", "High fidelity mockup showing tabs for recent activity, favorites, newest, and highest rated.", "Cards and tabs allow for extreme flexibility." %}
 
 {% image "src/images/D6AFilters.jpg", "High fidelity mockups showing search filters for status, category, author, rating, and date range.", "Filters allow for quick searching through relevant attributes." %}

 {% image "src/images/D6ABuilder.jpg", "A screen titled Welcome to the Recipe Builder, showing grid areas to add components and annotators.", "Horizontal layout of builder maximizes use of space, while allowing for display of necessary components." %}
