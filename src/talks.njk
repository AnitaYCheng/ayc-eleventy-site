<p>I believe in the power of knowledge. But to have power, knowledge must be shared. I share my knowledge and passion even with my <a href="/writing/freakin-unicorn">stutter</a>, because that's how much I believe.</p>

<p>I have spoken at Confab, An Event Apart, IA Conference, Code for America, and various events in San Francisco and Los Angeles.</p>

<p>As of 2024, Iâ€™m available for virtual conferences or events local to the San Francisco Bay Area. <a href="mailto:design@anitacheng.com">Email me</a> for details.</p>
