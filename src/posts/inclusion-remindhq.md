## A crash course on DEI: How to create more intentional designers by Alexis Lucio
*Original thread on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/anitaycheng/status/1196980997813760000 "Alexis Lucio gives a crash course on diveristy, equity, and inclusion")*

First up is [Alexis Lucio](https://www.alexislucio.com/) from Splunk to give us a crash course!

How do we design for diversity and inclusion in an environment that‚Äôs not diverse or inclusive? Alexis says to treat the disease, not the symptoms. You have to lean into the discomfort and learn the differences between diversity, inclusion, and equity.
- **Diversity**: Getting invited to the dance
- **Inclusion**: Getting asked to dance
- **Equity:** Making sure your music is played, offering slide scale to the dance, free transportation to those in need

We also need to know the differences between privilege and oppression. Privilege is special right afforded to few. Oppression is when a group is seen as lesser over time. 

Alexis says we should read [Tatiana Mac‚Äôs](https://www.tatianamac.com/) work. And pay people to teach you about this‚Äîit‚Äôs a lot of work!

To test things out, try [Google Lighthouse](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk?pli=1) and [WebAIM](https://wave.webaim.org/) screen reader simulation.

Get educated about gender! Look at the [‚Äúgender unicorn‚Äù](http://transstudent.org/gender). Also ask, does your product need to mention gender in the first place?

Translation is important! Google Translate was turning call-to-action buttons into shirt buttons for Alexis. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è (Personal note: Google Translate was turning ‚ÄúSan Francisco‚Äù to ‚ÄúNew York‚Äù in Chinese for us whenever ‚Äúthe City‚Äù was used! ü§£)

{% image "src/images/Pasted_image_20240620010049.jpg", "A slide with a 8 versions of programmatically incorrect ways of treating the name Bj√∂rn.", "‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt even get your customer‚Äôs name right, what are you doing as a designer‚ÄΩ‚Äù" %}

Things you can do now to promote true diversity and inclusion in your design work: educate yourself, start small, translate the need (it‚Äôs not just about compliance), find allies, and breathe! This work is really hard!

## Community-based approaches to building diversity by Jihern Baek
*Original thread on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/anitaycheng/status/1196985451296350208 "Jihern Baek‚Äôs talk about community-based approaches to building diversity")*

Up next is [Jihern Baek](https://jihern.com/) from [Thumbtack](https://www.thumbtack.com/) and [Inneract Project](https://www.inneractproject.org/) to talk about community-based approaches to building diversity! 

{% image "src/images/Pasted_image_20240620010418.jpg", "Jihern speaks into a mic in front of a slide with the content, 'Inneract Project is a non-profit organization that offers free design education to local, underrepresented youth.'", "Woohoo Google Slides captions, go!" %}

Design these programs for students. That way you think of the big picture and bring people along with you.

Empower students to drive their own learning. That drives true motivation. You also have to design in context. Invest long term and unconditionally. You have to reinforce the learnings. Get them outside support too.

What we can do: have convos at work, partner with nonprofits and local orgs, offer external mentorship!

## How an inclusive design framework leads to adaptive experiences by Shabi Kashani
*Original thread on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/anitaycheng/status/1196987967039868928 "Shabi Kashani‚Äòs talk about inclusive design frameworks")*

Next is [Shabi Kashani](https://www.shabikashani.com/) from Google sharing her framework around disabilities that promote an adaptive experience. We switched tasks every 3 minutes and switch devices 20 times an hour! Everyone‚Äôs behavior resembles ADD.

We are all disabled for learning in some way. Driving is situational, exhaustion is temporary, and ADD is permanent. Disability is a mismatch between one‚Äôs ability and their environment. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not the user‚Äôs fault!‚Äù

Spotify's ‚Äúcar view‚Äù adapts a typical mobile interface to focus on necessities (bigger fonts) and strips away things users don‚Äôt need.

Shabi‚Äôs framework: prioritize users with disabilities. Add alt text only when image is useful. People don‚Äôt need to know it‚Äôs an image of a fluffy cat if they‚Äôre trying to do something.

Pay attention to how headings are nested, and make sure they displayed. It‚Äôs how screenreader users navigate through a page.

Design for keyboard accessibility. You can use a screen reader, switch devices, and use a Braille keyboard too! But make sure you prioritize the tasks so keyboard users don‚Äôt have to tap a ton to get stuff done!

Think in systems. Be aware of the contexts that people are using your products. People with disabilities often don‚Äôt have a choice in what devices they can use.

How to fight ableism in your work: prioritize user needs, accept all inputs and outputs, think in systems.

## Inclusivity is not a checkbox by Aiden Zucker
*Original thread on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/anitaycheng/status/1196992784315502593 "Aiden Zucker talks about Remind‚Äôs work and how inclusivity is not a checkbox")*

We finally learn what [Remind](https://www.remind.com/) does! It helps teachers communicate with their students. Equity is a big goal of theirs‚Äîhow is your product uniquely position to address inequity? For instance, we can‚Äôt assume every student has a smartphone. 19% of US does not!

Remind isn‚Äôt just a smartphone app, it sends text messages. It costs money to send texts, but worth it to make sure all students have the same opportunities.

We assume every students in the US speaks English at home, but 78% do. Remind would miss out on parent engagement that way. Critical for student success!

{% image "src/images/Pasted_image_20240620014134.jpg", "A photo of the Popemobile in a dense crowd, with a large sign titled 'Welcome Potato' just a few feet away.", "Oop another translation glitch example‚Äîon a welcome sign, ‚ÄúPope‚Äù turned into ‚Äúpotato‚Äù via Spanish translation." %}

Remind did video calls with teachers all across the US to hear how they used translations. Google Translate isn‚Äôt all bad, but sometimes it can Be Bad. (‚ÄúTraffic collision‚Äù turned into ‚Äúdismembered head‚Äù in Russian!)

By letting their user set their preferred language, Remind helped empower teachers to send messages right to their target audience. Remind also hires professional translators to help! They‚Äôre always looking to get better.

How to make sure inclusivity is not a checkbox. Answer these questions: What is your product trying to achieve? Who are you designing for? What is your product uniquely positioned to address? Consider the nature of your product, talk to extreme users.

## Panel with speakers
To evangelize for accessibility, Alexis says to talk about future tech debt, work with product managers on timelines. Shabi suggests talking about your users.

And don‚Äôt forget that you can get sued now for having inaccessible websites! [Persis Howe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/persishowe/) (personal note: my boss at SF Digital Services) asks if we will ever cross the line from inequity to discrimination.
