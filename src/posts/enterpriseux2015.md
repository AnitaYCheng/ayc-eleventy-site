## We're in UX to help people
UXers think, “This is bullshit, and I want to help fix this.”

## UX has to recruit all other team members to get buy-in
Book rec: It’s Our Research by Erika Hall.

Always fight for research, otherwise the HIPPO (Highest Paid Person's Opinion) will kick your ass.

## Enterprise needs to move slowly and not break their legacy tech
Enterprise doesn’t have the luxury of using a scorched earth strategy when dealing with legacy tech.

Think of the long game. Build relationships with your stakeholders. Build a design roadmap to keep yourself on track as you compromise in the current product.

Compromise shitty legacy tech with unicorn design. Make a unicorn out of trash, aka a “trashicorn.”

## Test with your customers
Use data-informed design. Data analytics is helpful, but won’t tell you the why.

How to find users to test with:
- Recruit the sales team (could also help with how much to pay them too)
- Hit up LinkedIn groups
- Use market research agencies
- Go guerilla! Hit up personal networks, cold-call.
