# Hi, I’m Anita!

## Content designer, information architect, occasional front-end developer, perpetual do-gooder
I’m a former cancer researcher who switched to tech to help people faster. Currently, I’m helping to clarify federal government services at [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/).

I love to chat with other career-changers! [Book a mentoring call with me on ADPList](https://adplist.org/mentors/anita-cheng).
